1. This project is used for uploading multiple videos in NodeJS using the multer library. This project 
is used not only for uploading a video to server but also upload to AWS S3 with the aws sdk v3.

3. My learning to this project includes: how to connect with aws s3 service for uploading both images and 
videos, building a project with multer and uuid and many more libaries. connecting with postman with given 
endpoint, configuring aws s3 credentials with nodejs and so on.
